## Acknowledgements

The Udacity Nanodegree program to becoming a Full-Stack Web Developer was used to lay out the structure of the code and organize the code.
The mentors in Udacity helped me gain a greater understanding of the code.
The Knockout documentation and tutorials were thoroughly studied to further understand binding, functions, and other Knockout applications.
The Google Maps API documentation was used to properly create the markers, map, and infowindows.
The Wikipedia API was used to bring further information in the infowindows.
https://jsfiddle.net/pkysylevych/tfAJy/ was used as inspiration for the set-up of the dropdown filter
